Cheers Cyber is a friendly community for cyber and information security product managers, set up as a [Slack](https://slack.com/) workplace. This group acts as an informal forum for exchanging ideas, perspectives, materials and advice on product management in the field so illusive that its name alone is the subject of unending debates.

To join Cheers Cyber you typically need to meet all of the following criteria:

* Be a person who is respectful of other persons;
* Manage a product that your organizaion provides to external constituents; and
* Manage a product that is directly related to cyber or information security.

Note that in this context, "product management" does _not_ refer to the practice of managing third-party technologies on behalf of your organization. Instead, your role needs to focus on creating or nurturing a product that your organization provides to others.

If you satisfy these criteria, please fill out a short form to [request joining Cheers Cyber](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYCoyYG1jf2YyijWFVWC5b0IExt6OuLQtj0Bb2vKhNvsybxw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
