# About Cheers Cyber

Cheers Cyber is a friendly community for cyber and information security product managers, set up as a [Slack](https://slack.com/) workplace. This informal group acts as a forum for exchanging ideas, perspectives, materials and advice related to product management in the field so illusive that its name alone is the subject of unending debates.

# Joining Cheers Cyber

Members of Cheers Cyber typically meet all of the following criteria:

* Are persons who are respectful of other persons;
* Manage a product that your organizaion provides to external constituents; and
* Manage a product that is directly related to cyber or information security.

Note that in this context, "product management" does _not_ refer to the practice of managing third-party technologies on behalf of your organization. Instead, the role focuses on creating or nurturing a product that your organization built for others.
